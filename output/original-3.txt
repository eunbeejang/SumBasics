B.C. government announces the first urgent care centre to be built in Surrey. The B.C. government is fulfilling a major campaign promise by opening the first urgent primary-care centre in the province by November. Premier John Horgan announced the new Surrey Urgent Primary Care Centre will be integrated into the current Fraser Health network and will ease the burden on local emergency rooms. “We are making innovative changes to public health care so that it works for British Columbians, providing them with timely, effective care in their communities,” Horgan said.
