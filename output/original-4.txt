California is burning, again. Dozens of peoples have been killed and thousands of buildings destroyed in several fires, the most destructive in the stateâ€™s history. The current California fires reflect a complex mix of climate, social, and ecological factors. Fuels across California are currently highly combustible due to a prolonged drought and associated low humidity and high air temperatures. Indeed, it is so dry fires burn freely through the night. Such extreme weather conditions have the fingerprints of climate change.
