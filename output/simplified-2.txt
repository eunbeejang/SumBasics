They have to sound funny, too. If they've got the "oo" sound, found in 17.4 per cent of the words judged most funny, that's good. So is a hard "kay" or an ending in "le." Double letters are also funny. Westbury confirmed his findings by using them to predict how funny people would find a given word. "I was amazed at how well we were able to predict judgments." Interestingly, age and gender made almost no difference in what people found amusing. Culture, however, did.
