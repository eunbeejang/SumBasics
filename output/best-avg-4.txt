California is burning, again. Dozens of peoples have been killed and thousands of buildings destroyed in several fires, the most destructive in the stateâ€™s history. Forecasts of fresh rainfall could help extinguish the remaining flames, but might also hinder rescue efforts. About 1100 residents were still under evacuation orders in Malibu and unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County, down from 250,000 at the height of the fire. Investigators continue to probe the cause of the Camp Fire, as survivors spent Thanksgiving in warehouses and tents in the city of Chico.
